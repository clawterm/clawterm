# Keybindings

Every keybinding shipped with Clawterm, grouped by category. The **Mod** column shows the primary modifier for your platform: `Cmd` on macOS, `Ctrl` on Windows and Linux.

All bindings marked **configurable** can be remapped in `config.json` under the `keybindings` block — see [configuration.md](./configuration.md#keybindings). Hardcoded bindings cannot be changed.

Source of truth: [`src/config.ts`](../../src/config.ts) (defaults) and [`src/keybinding-handler.ts`](../../src/keybinding-handler.ts) (dispatch logic).

## Zoom

| Action | Default | Config key | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Zoom in | `Mod+=` | `zoomIn` | Also matches `Mod+Shift+=` / `Mod++` |

| Reload config | `Mod+Shift+R` | `reloadConfig` | Picks up edits to `config.json` without restarting |

## Quick commands

Quick commands are user-defined keybindings that **type a string into the active pane** instead of triggering an action. They live in `config.json` under `quickCommands` as `{ "binding": "text to type" }` pairs.

| Default binding | Text typed | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Mod+Shift+C` | `claude --dangerously-skip-permissions\n` | Launch Claude Code with permission prompts suppressed |

See [configuration.md](./configuration.md#quickcommands) for the full format and more examples.

## Binding format

Keybindings are strings of the form `modifier+modifier+key`, lowercase, joined with `+`:

- **Modifiers:** `cmd`, `ctrl`, `shift`, `alt` (`opt` is accepted as an alias for `alt`)
- **Keys:** single characters (`a`–`z`, `0`–`9`), punctuation (`[`, `]`, `=`, `-`, `,`, `.`, `/`, `;`, `'`, `` ` ``, `\`), or arrow keys
- `cmd` maps to the Meta key (⌘ on macOS); `ctrl` maps to Control. They are treated as **distinct** modifiers, so a binding that uses `cmd` will not fire on a `Ctrl` press.

Shifted punctuation is handled automatically: a binding of `cmd+=` also matches `Cmd+Shift+=` (which produces `+` on most layouts).

Invalid keybinding strings are logged and reset to the default for that action.
